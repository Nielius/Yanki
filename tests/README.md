This directory contains shell scripts and files to test Yanki.

A short description of the shell scripts and what order to use them in appears in
[the .ok file](.ok).
(See [this explanation](http://www.secretgeek.net/ok) of ok files if you want to know more.)
(The first shell script, `getexamplefiles.sh`, is probably only useful for me:
it takes the Yanki files from my documents.)
Before using the scripts, make sure that the variables in `variables.sh`
point to the collection that you want to use.
