  # *** characterisation of normality
  question: >-
    Classify the normal integral affine curves among the integral affine curves
    in terms of the function field, and in terms of open subsets.
  answer: >-
    Every finite morphism that induces an isomorphism on the function fields, is in fact an isomorphism.
    (Isn't finiteness automatic? Probably not.)
    In other words, it is the largest finite extension with the same fraction field.
    This can again be rephrased as: if a finite morphism is an isomorphism on an open subset,
    then it is an isomorphism.

  # fundamental group of integral proper normal curve over $\bC$ minus $n$ points
  question: >-
    Let $U \subset C$ be an open in an integral proper normal curve $C$ over $\bC$ with the complement
    consisting of $n$ points. Give a presentation of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(U)$.
  answer: >-
    It is the same as the profinite completion of the Riemann surface associated
    to $U$. That means that a presentation is given by the loops coming from the
    genus (2 for each hole, $a_i$ and $b_i$) and one loop for every missing point,
    with the relation $[a_1, b_1] \cdots [a_g, b_g] \gamma_1 \cdots \gamma_n = 1$.

  # *** Grothendieck's theorem about the fundamental group of $U \subset X$, $X$ proper normal integral over any $k = \bar k$
  question: >-
    Let $X$ be a integral normal proper curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$
    of genus $g$
    and let $U \subset X$ be an open subset (complement of $n$ points).
    What is the prime-to-p completion of $\pi_1(U)$?
    If $\char k > 0$, what is its pro-p-part?
  answer: >-
    The profinite prime-to-p completion is exactly the same as over $\bC$ (see previous question).
    The pro-p-part iis a free pro-p group of rank the $p$-rank of the Jacobian if $U = X$
    (which, by definition, is $\dim_{\bF_p} \ker ([p] \colon A(k) \to A(k))$)
    and of infinite rank equal to the cardinality of $k$ otherwise.

  # what can you say about hyperbolic curves over a finite field
  question: >-
    What can you say about hyperbolic curves over a finite field?
  answer: >-
    By a theorem by Tamagawa and Mochizuki,
    the isomorphism between such curves are in bijection (via the natural map)
    with the isomorphisms between the fundamental groups.

  # Stein factorisation
  question: >-
    State the Stein factorisation. Prove it.
  answer: >-
    Any proper morphism factors as a finite morphism followed by a morphism ``with
    geometrically connected fibers'' (actually, a morphism with $\phi_* \cO_X = \cO_S$, which implies
    geometrically connected fibers).

  # fundamental group of abelian varieties
  question: >-
    What is the étale fundamental group of an abelian variety?
  answer: >-
    If you're over an algebraically closed field (otherwise, there is of course the arithmetic contribution),
    it is commutative and isomorphic to the full Tate module (which is the product of all $T_\ell(A)$).

  # Cebotarev density
  question: State the Cebotarev density theorem.
  answer: >-
    Take a Galois cover $Y \to X$ (not sure why this is necessary)
    and let $G$ be the Galois group.
    Then every subset $C \subset G$ (note: subset, not even subgroup!) 
    that is stable under conjugation contains
    the image of some Frobenius element in $\pi_1(X,x)$ (and hence its entire conjugacy class).
    A different (more general? only works for number fields?) statement can be found in [http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~hwl/papers/cheb.pdf](these notes) by Lenstra and Stevenhagen:
    it says that for any Galois extension of a number field, with Galois group $G$,
    and any conjugacy class $C \subset G$,
    $\# C/\#G$ is the density of the primes that have a Frobenius element in $C$.
