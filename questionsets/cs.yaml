  question: >-
    Classify the normal integral affine curves among the integral affine curves
    in terms of the function field, and in terms of open subsets.
  answer: >-
    Every finite morphism that induces an isomorphism on the function fields, is in fact an isomorphism.
    (Isn't finiteness automatic? Probably not.)
    In other words, it is the largest finite extension with the same fraction field.
    This can again be rephrased as: if a finite morphism is an isomorphism on an open subset,
    then it is an isomorphism.

  question: >-
    What is the difference between dynamical and lexical scoping?
    Give the definitions, compare and give an example where you notice the difference between the two.
  answer: >-
    Dynamical scoping means that the run-time state of the program (i.e., where in the program is this code run?
    (what does the stack look like, which function called it, ...)) determines what a variable refers to.
    Lexical scoping means that the structure of the code determines what a variable refers to.

    You can see the difference when a function g calls a function f that refers to some global variable:
    in lexical scope, the variables in f refer to what you would think of you just looked at the source code,
    but in dynamic scope, if g redefines the variable, this new definition holds in f.
