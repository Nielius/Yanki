# QUESTION = STR | LIST OF EXERCISES
#
# Here answer, ref are strings.
# Maybe we'll demand a question, but not an answer or reference? 


# alternatives:
# Misschien is dit de syntax?
# BLOCK = QUESTION | (LIST OF QUESTIONS)
# QUESTION = mapping {question: 'q', answer: 'a', ref: 'ref'}
#
# Maybe a block can additionally have a reference?

# Of dit:
# EXERCISE = {QUESTION, ANSWER, REF} | LIST OF EXERCISES
#
# Here question, answer, ref are strings.
# Maybe we'll demand a question, but not an answer or reference? 
# This has the disadvantage that an exercise cannot be a list of exercises together with an

question: |
  Bewijs de links/rechts-exactheid van alle six functors en geef
  tegenvoorbeelden. Noem de situaties waarin de functor vanwege een eigenschap
  als "gesloten embedding" ofzo toch wel exact is. Ihb: beantwoord deze vraag
  nog een keer voor $i$ een gesloten embedding en $j$ een open embedding.
answer: |
  The six operations:
  $f^!$, $f_!$, $f_*$, $f^*$, $\Hom(\dash, \dash$, $\otimes$ (where the Hom and
  tensor are internal).

  Left-exactness (resp., right-exactness) in a derived category with t-structure
  is defined as mapping $D^{\geq 0}$ to $D^{\geq 0}$ (resp, $D^{\leq 0}$ to
  $D^{\leq 0}$).

  I think the following statements are true:
  (1) if a functor is left- or right-exact, then so is its derived functor (this
  follows basically from the definition: take projective/injective resolution,
  apply functor, etc.); and

  See also [[pdfview:/home/niels/md/perverse-sheaves/BBD.djvu::20][proposition
  1.3.17]] in BBD, which says the following. You might expect a left adjoint
  derived functor to right exact (as is the case for abelian categories). This is
  not necessarily true. What is true, however, is that it is right exact if and
  only if its right adjoint is left exact. In that case, there $\rH^0$s form a
  pair of adjoint functors. (Can we find a counter example to this last statement?
  Can we find it if we assume that injectives are mapped to the heart? see
  [[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/244586/when-is-a-functor-a-right-derived-functor/244670]].
  And does it mean that the derived functors are in fact the derived functors of
  this adjoint pair?)

  I think that the following statements are also true:
  (1) if $f_!$ is right-exact (as it would be if it were a left-adjoint),
  then $Rf_!$ is left-adjoint to a functor $f^!$;
  (2) proposition 1.3.17 in BBD (see above) shows that this implies that $f^!$ is
  left-exact and that $(f_!, H^0 f^!)$ forms an adjoint pair; and
  (3) $f^!$ is the derived functor of $H^0 f^!$.
  This last statement follows, I think, from the fact that the derived functor is
  right adjoint to $Rf_!$, and probably adjoints are unique in the derived
  category too.


  $f^*$ is not left-exact --- in special cases, it is the same as taking the
  fiber. (This is not exact: take e.g. $\cO \incl \cO(x)$; looking at the fiber
  is the same as considering the ``value'', but of course this is different in
  $\cO$ than in $\cO(x)$.) Or differently: we restrict to some closed subscheme,
  so of course the submodule of all functions vanishing there will be zero (so
  it does not preserve the inclusion of this submodule). Algebraically: we mod
  out by some ideal. NB: $f^{-1}$ for $f$ the inclusion of a point is taking the
  stalk; but in $f^*$ we also tensor, so that we get in fact the fiber.

  $f_*$ is not right-exact -- in the case $f \colon X \to \pt$,
  this is just taking global sections. This is not right exact,
  because if we have a surjection $\cF \to \cG$,
  then $\cG$ is a quotient of $\cF$,
  so the glueing condition on $\cG$ is a bit laxer.
  This means that some collection of germs may glue to a global section of $\cG$
  while at the same time not glueing to a global section of $\cF$.
  Homological viewpoint: we know that some sheaves have higher cohomology groups.
  But monodromy can also be a problem: if we consider sheaf of sets on $j \colon \bC^* \incl \bC$,
  and $F$ corresponds to the universal cover of $\bC^*$, while $G$ is constantly one element,
  then $F \to G$ is a surjection, but $j_* F \to j_* G$ is not, as is easily seen by looking at the stalk at zero
  (which is empty for $F$, but not for $G$).


  $f_!$ \emph{is} left-exact, \emph{contrary to what you would expect} from the adjunction --
  says [[https://math.berkeley.edu/~vivek/274/lec7.pdf][Vivek Shende]].
  It is not right-exact: if it were, then compact spaces wouldn't have any
  cohomology
  (because for the map $p \colon X \to \pt$, we have $p_* = p_!$).

  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE FOLLOWING ``PROOF'' OF THE FALSEHOOD THAT $f_!$ is not
  left-exact? The mistake (which I've made before), was that for any sheaf $\cF$,
  the skyscraper sheaf $i_{x*} \cF_x$ is a subsheaf of $\cF$. This ``natural'' map
  is not a map of presheaves, as can easily be seen by checking the compatability
  of the restriction with the map. (Intuitively: the sections should really be
  sections inside $\cF$, so their restrictions should also work as expected. This
  then also proves why $f_!$ is actually left-exact.)

  if we take $f \colon X \to \pt$, we see that it is
  taking global compactly supported sections; it is easily possible that a
  subsheaf has compactly supported sections (e.g., it is a skyscraper sheaf),
  while the larger sheaf doesn't (e.g. it is the constant sheaf on $\bA^1$). The
  homological viewpoint allows a proof similar to that of $f_*$: there are sheaves
  that have compactly supported cohomology in higher degree. Shouldn't this be
  true of $\bA^n$ for example? (It should have cohomology in degree $2n$ or
  something.)

  [[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/3312/when-does-direct-image-with-proper-support-have-a-right-adjoint][gerelateerde info]]

  Of course, if $i_* = i_!$ (closed embedding), then both are exact (as they are
  both a left- and a right-adjoint (since $i^!$ exists as an actual
  (non-derived) functor by
  [[pdfview:/home/niels/md/Iversen,%20Birger%20-%20Cohomology%20of%20sheaves-Springer-Verlag%20(1986).djvu::118][prop
  6.6]] in Iversen). Similarly if $j^! = j^*$ (open embedding). But there are
  some surprises: $j_!$ is also right-exact (it is extension by zero), so exact;
  and $i^*$ is also left-exact (it is restriction; and you ``keep infinitesimal
  information'').
  However, $j_*$ and $i^!$ are still only left-exact (all the others are in fact exact),
  as is also claimed in [[pdfview:/home/niels/md/perverse-sheaves/BBD.djvu::23][BBD]] (start of §1.4).
  The functor $j_*$ is not right-exact because of monodromy problems (see above for $f_*$);
  the functor $i^!$ is not right-exact: take a locally constant sheaf mapping surjectively to a torsion sheaf
  supported at a point $x$; then pull back by the embedding of $x$

  Interesting question: can you get all useful information for locally closed
  $Z$ by knowing how it works for open and how it works for closed?
